This directory contains API keys and secrets for any service for which those
are necessary. Obviously those keys should not go in source control.

Hence, a .gitignore file in this directory ignores all *.scala files.

Format of the keys file is like so:
==== Twitter.scala ====

package code
package keys

/* API keys for pitfail_app1
 * Only should be given Read access
 * Used for authorization of users to the webpage.
 */
object Twitter {
	val consumerKey     = "..."
	val consumerSecret  = "..."
}

/* API keys for pf_frontend
 * Requires Read and Write permissions.
 * Used for accessing the Application account.
 */
object RWTwitter {
	val consumerKey     = "..."
	val consumerSecret  = "..."

	val accessToken = "..."
	val accessTokenSecret = "..."
	val accessUser = "user_the_keys_are_for"
}
